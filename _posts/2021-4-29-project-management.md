# Building a Lightweight Project-Management System

Project management is an area where I spend much of my time. As a student, researcher, and developer. It’s not uncommon for me to have many projects in flight simultaneously that span educational requirements, professional tasks, and personal interests. For better or worse, I am in complete control over my time. With few exceptions, I can choose exactly how much time I spend on any project that falls into any of those categories. If I’m not careful and extremely deliberate with my time, any one of those categories of how I want to spend my time could quickly become neglected (this is excluding the very real challenge I have balancing work, school, and life, but I’ll leave that for a future blog post).

The point of this post isn’t to discuss how I manage my time… well at least its not entirely about that. I’m writing this primarily with the goal for describing a workflow that works for me. Before I dive into all that, what I describe is less about the tools, and more about the underlying processes and separation of information, though I will briefly mention all the tools that I use for project management. Be warned, I’m a heavy user of Apple products, so certain apps might not be available in every platform.

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - task management
- [Craft](https://www.craft.do) - notes and internal documentation*
- [Notion](https://notion.so) - project management
- Apple Reminders - fallback for task management

### Task Management:

As listed in my above tools, I use two apps for task management: Things and Apple Reminders. Just to get it out of the way, Apple Reminders is my lightweight task manager. I’ll use it because of the tight integration it shares with Apple’s products, and I can give myself contextual reminders that are cumbersome otherwise (location based reminders, simplified task entry with Siri, iCloud syncing and cross device notifications, etc.).

Things is the real work horse of my task management platform. Now, you might be thinking “Hey Nos, I thought you were not going to talk about specific apps”, and you’d be right. I won’t be. The important distinction I’ll be making is the features in Things that make my processes work, but its important to note that these are not by any means unique to things. Off the top of my head I know that Apple Reminders, Todoist, and many other apps share many of these features, but hey teach what you know right? Anyways, onto the *process*.

The first major requirement for task management is projects/list support. Not every task should have a project (remembering to buy that last minute gift for someone probably doesn’t need a project), but it helps to collate similar/related tasks together in a single list view. It also helps when two tasks have very similar names, and increased verbosity is a chore. Having two “final exam” tasks on your to-do list for the day is confusing, until you can see the additional context.

One additional feature that is incredibly useful that many task management app’s have is the ability to provide text or additional information within the context of a task. I like to keep this extremely short, since larger details about a task belongs (in my mind) in a project management app. All I use a description field for is allowing me to quickly reference the most important bit of information I might need about a task as I’m completing it.

Perhaps the most important distinction in this section is deceitfully simple: What is a task? A task in the scope of my workflow is a reasonably short task that needs to be accomplished, usually by a certain time. It might be an assignment for a course, a bug to fix in a software development project, and experiment to re-run with certain details, etc. In rare cases, larger tasks can have sub-tasks, but that quickly blurs the line between a project and a task.

I know this is a rather pedantic distinction, and we’re really getting into the details, but this is simply what works for me. A major disclaimer to this is that you should adjust and tweak this to match your workflow.

### Notes and Internal Documentation

As a student and researcher (and developer who can’t remember how the code I wrote works the day after I wrote it), notes play a very large part of my day to day productivity. Craft fills this gap and does it incredibly well for me, but really any note-taking system will work. My methodology here is dead simple: **write down everything**.

I never want to have forgotten something, or have to go search for something on a reference site, so I will dump as much information as I can when researching something into Craft. Anything I think I might need goes into notes, and is organized as best I can for the project I’m working on. There it becomes immediately searchable, and available everywhere.

As huge of a part of my life as this app/process is, there isn’t much to talk about. This platform simply serves as a place that I can always look to, in order to remember or store information that I might otherwise have forgotten, and it saves me time in doing so.

Bonus, I am writing this post right now in Craft, and will export it to markdown for uploading to my site.

### Project Management

Now, before I can begin this section and start talking about Notion, I need to first address some of the obvious, inevitable discussion points that all the Notion lovers will tell you. Yes, Notion could theoretically fill “all” my needs that the above apps fill, so here are some counterpoints:

- At the time of writing this, Notion still has no offline mode and [I don't want to download my entire Notion workspace as a non-native web-page in an app every time I need to check what I'm doing today](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com).
- Separating my work between apps personally helps me think. I can digitally “spread out” in a way that I might if I was using pen and paper, but with the portability to work from anywhere.
- Frankly, I’m a bit of a nerd for new and amazing apps, and Craft and Things are both objectively better apps for my platforms than Notion is currently. Notion is amazing and powerful, but other apps align with my needs better (have I mentioned that its not a native app?).

Now, with that out of the way, lets jump into how I’m using Notion. Similar to my note taking strategy, my approach here is pretty straightforward. Projects are divided into pages and usually contain a description of each project I might be working on, an outline of the general roadmap of the project, and generally a Notion database.

These databases are where Notion really shines in my opinion. Notion’s databases are very flexible and can allow for visualizing projects as a kanban board, in tabular format, or whatever works best for the project. Tags can be added to filter entries into the database, and I treat this as a repository for all of the tasks that need to be done on a project. I can track their status, detailed information about a specific task, and other important information that doesn’t fit within a task management app like Things. Then when its time to work on a project, I can create an entry for it in my to-do app, and update both when it is complete or when there is an update.

Notion is the most general part of my processes, and it catches most information and relevant information that doesn’t fall into the other categories.

### Last Remarks

The most important part about the system that I described isn’t any app, but the underlying separation of information and responsibility. By separating information into distinct apps, managing  tasks becomes easier.

One of the biggest challenges that I (and presumably many other students) face is dealing with the complexities of balancing school, jobs, and personal interests, without losing track of of anything The above system is the best method I’ve found to combat this challenge.

As with any system, it will grow and change over time. Systems should meet the needs of their users. The underlying tools might change more often than the process, and I’ll update this post, or make a new, shorter post when it does, but for now this is the system I’m going with.

As always, thanks for reading.
